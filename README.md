# Computational Problem Solving

COSC326 is a paper that aims to improve and develop programming skills by setting a series of exercises that require an analytical and creative approach to problem solving. Most, but not all, of these exercises will involve programming tasks. Some will not use computers at all; some will use them only for ancillary tasks. Each solution will be assessed against the requirements, and students will be expected to go back and rework each problem until it is completed satisfactorily.

In this repository is my solutions to these études. By clicking into a folder the étude description is included in the form of a PDF and a README file that explains my solution.
